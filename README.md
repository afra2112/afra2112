# Hi, I'm Andres Ramirez 👋

Backend Developer focused on building secure, maintainable and well-structured systems using the Java ecosystem.

I care about architecture, clean code, and understanding how things work under the hood — not just making them work.

## 🧠 Core Stack

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- JPA / Hibernate
- REST APIs
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- Maven / Gradle

---

## 🏗 Architectural Focus

- Clean Architecture
- Hexagonal Architecture
- Layered Architecture
- SOLID principles
- Exception handling strategies
- Security-first design

---

## 📂 Repository Naming Convention

I follow a structured naming pattern for repositories: [type]-[domain]-[focus]


### Types:
- `practice-*` → focused technical experiments
- `college-*` → academic projects
- `personal-*` → independent projects
- `template-*` → reusable architecture bases

### Examples:
- `practice-hexagonal-architecture`
- `practice-spring-security`
- `college-terranova-api`
- `template-spring-clean-architecture`

## 🎯 What I'm Currently Working On

- Improving security architecture in Spring applications
- Designing global exception handling strategies
- Deepening understanding of authentication flows
- Writing cleaner service-layer logic
- Building production-ready REST APIs

---

## 🚀 Long-Term Goal

To design backend systems that are:
- Predictable
- Testable
- Secure
- Easy to extend
- Easy to reason about
